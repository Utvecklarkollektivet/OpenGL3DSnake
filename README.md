3D Snake
==========
This is supposed to be a very simple snake game rendered by OpenGL 3.x, programmed in C++.

Try it!
========
Instructions how to compile and run the game will be here (maybe the makefile could be used?).

Libraries used:
FreeGLUT
GLEW
GL extensions


Feel free to use the code in any way possible!

GL_utilities is writted by Ingemar Ragnemalm (until I make my own version of the needed functions :) ).
